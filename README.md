# Regression and Classification Algorithms

This repository contains the implementation of various machine learning algorithms I am learning as part of Andrew Ng's **Machine Learning** course on Coursera. The focus is on supervised learning methods, particularly **regression** and **classification**.

## Repository Contents

The repository is divided into the following sections:

1. **Linear Regression**: Implementations and exercises involving simple and multiple linear regression, using gradient descent and normal equation methods.
   
2. **Logistic Regression**: Implementations of binary classification problems, including the logistic function and decision boundaries.

3. **Polynomial Regression**: Higher-order regression for modeling non-linear relationships.

4. **Classification Algorithms**: Exploration of various classification techniques, including but not limited to:
   - Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
   - Decision Trees
   - k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

## Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for the implementations.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and matrix operations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for implementing algorithms and evaluation metrics.

## Course Overview

The concepts implemented in this repository follow the structure of the **Machine Learning** course by **Andrew Ng** on Coursera. The topics cover:

- Supervised learning, including linear and logistic regression.
- Machine learning algorithms, including gradient descent and regularization.
- Practical implementation of algorithms for regression and classification tasks.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/regression-classification.git

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Explore the notebooks or Python scripts in each section to follow the progression of concepts.

## Future Work
I will continuously update this repository as I progress through the course and implement more advanced algorithms like Neural Networks and Deep Learning.
